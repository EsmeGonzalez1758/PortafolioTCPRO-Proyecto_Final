# components
* nav: It is a container for navigation links, which are supposed to provide ways to access sections of the website, as well as external documents. Links within this element are assumed to be for a main navigation block only.
* section: Represents a generic section of a document. It is used to determine which content corresponds to which part of a schema.
* span: It is a generic inline container element. Span tags typically wrap sections of text for styling purposes or to add attributes to a section of text without creating a new line of content.
* badge: Very useful elements to highlight new elements, show a small count or label elements.
* div: It is used to create sections or group content.

carousel: It's a slideshow to scroll through a series of content, created with 3D CSS transformations and a bit of JavaScript.
* footer: Indicates the term of the website within the structure.
* Script: small programming language whose code is inserted into the HTML document. This code is executed in the user's browser when the page loads, or when something special happens, such as clicking on a link.
* let: The let statement declares a local scope variable with block scope, which can optionally be initialized with some value.
* typewriter: A simple yet powerful native javascript plugin for a cool typewriter effect.
